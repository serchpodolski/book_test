# book_test
test code for publishing with flask

The repository contains two files:
-app.py: Contains a simple Flask application that runs a simple linear regression model and provides a prediction on a separate HTML page.
-streamapp.py: Contains a simple Streamlit app that runs its own html from within the app and displays the linear regression prediction within the same page.
